## **FEATURES**

The website has 15 responsive pages, counting the Home page, the Rules page, the Highscore page, the Enter name first page, the quiz and finally a page that dispays the users score after the game. The Quiz contains 10 pages with different questions/ answers and a unique images displayed for each one. 
By using correct HTML markup and labels it is ensured screen readers can accurately interpret the pages.

&nbsp;

### **FOOTER**

- The footer is fixed on every page and contains the media links to owners LinkedIn page and GitHub page, so that anyone who plays the quiz can easily can get in contact withe owner for feedback.

## **DESIGN**

### **Colors**

- A complementary color was added for sharp contrast 
- These design choices was thought to help create a visually appealing and cohesive website that will leave a positive impression on our visitors.

### **Fonts**

- Logo /h1: Arial??? 

### **Structure**
The site has been designed with a user-friendly and intuitive structure. Upon arrival, the user is greeted with a ????????????????????????????????

The website is composed of :

- The homepage, which features ?????????????????

By organizing the content into distinct pages, the website makes it easy for users to navigate and find the information they are looking for. Additionally, the use of a consistent navigation bar and footer throughout the website ensures that users can always find their way back to the main sections of the website and find the social media links.

### **Accessibility**

I have coded to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. This was done by:

* Using semantic HTML elements.
* Declare the Language in the beginning the html page.
* Using descriptive alt-attributes on images and links on the site.
* Using a hover funtion on all buttons so it's clear for the user if they are hovering over a button.
* Providing information for screen readers where there are icons used and no text.
* Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
* Ensuring menus are accessible by marking the current page as current for screen readers.

The WAVE WebAIM web accessibility evaluation tool was used to ensure the website met high accessibility standards. The application pass except for one error, see provided image below. It concerns a hidden error-message that occurs if the user doesn't type their name correctly in the input field. 

See [results](https://wave.webaim.org/report???????????????????)
